}

Cut and paste into documentation.

In case you run into [issues](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/4119) with [sandboxed](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/conf-file.html#conf-sandbox) builds, you can disable the sandbox temporary with `--option sandbox false`.

To learn how to add additional VMs, check out [flake.nix](flake.nix) (look for `mkVm`).

VMs can also be build out-of-tree, see this [example](examples/darwin/nixos-vm).

The QEMU package provided and used by this configuration comes with support for hardware accelerated graphics, based on the awesome work of [Akihiko Odaki](https://gist.github.com/akihikodaki/87df4149e7ca87f18dc56807ec5a1bc5).

The '[qemuGuest](#qemu-guest)' module provides a bunch of useful configuration options for QEMU guests.
